    <h1 id="seo-implementation-basics">SEO Implementation Basics</h1>
<p>SEO is short for Search Engine Optimization. In this article I will lay out the basics of SEO, giving you the tools necessary to boost up your website/blog in the Google Search engine. Usually businesses and entrepreneurs hire someone to do SEO research for them, but maybe you don&rsquo;t have the money necessary to hire someone or you just want to learn SEO and don&rsquo;t know where to start. If you find yourself in one of these situations, then this article is for you.</p>
<h2 id="keyword-research">Keyword Research</h2>
<p>Keyword research is the process of finding and analyzing search terms that people enter into search engines, with the goal of using that data for SEO or general web
marketing.</p>
<p>If you have a project in mind, look up the keywords in Google Search to see if the results are close to what you have in mind as a project.</p>
<p>Also, there are multiple websites that will check how high these words are ranking. For example, <a href="https://wordtracker.com">Word Tracker</a> allows you to use a limited version of their site, where you get 12 free searches.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!tip]
You can get 12 more by accessing their site in incognito mode.  </p></blockquote>
<p>Keyword research can uncover queries to target, the popularity of these queries, their ranking difficulty, and so on.</p>
<p>There are two types of keywords:</p>
<h3 id="short-tail-keywords">Short-tail keywords</h3>
<p>Sometimes referred to as <em>head terms</em>, are often one or two words long. These are much more competitive, meaning there are more websites that have the same keywords, and so you have a lot more competition to rank highly for them. Short-tail keywords also tend to  attract a wider range of users, many of which won’t necessarily be looking for what your application is offering.</p>
<h3 id="long-tail-keywords">Long-tail keywords</h3>
<p>They&rsquo;re longer, and often come in the form of a phrase or sentence. These keywords are more specific than short tail keywords. The advantage of long-tail keywords is that the intention behind the search is clearer, not to mention competition is lower.
For example a short tail search for “pans” doesn’t tell the search engine if you’re looking to buy towels, or want to know about how towels are made. But a long-tail search such as “buy non-stick pans” is explicit about the intention of the user. And if your business specializes in high quality non-stick pans, the chances of appearing high on their search results are better. </p>
<h3 id="questions-to-ask">Questions to Ask</h3>
<ol>
<li>What types of topics would your customers search for that you would want your business to get found for?</li>
<li>What are common questions these customers have? What do they need that they might search online for?</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="doing-your-research">Doing Your Research</h3>
<p>Put yourself in a user&rsquo;s place and think what would the user type in their search engine so that they&rsquo;ll come across your website. Brainstorm short-tail and as well as long-tail keywords in order to find the best keywords.</p>
<p>For instance, I&rsquo;m currently working on an e-commerce website that sells honey products. After a brainstorming session thinking about the products that this website sells, I came up with these short-tail and long-tail keywords.</p>
<p>Once you have a long enough list of keywords, feel free to select a few that would then be implemented (see below how) organically in your website.</p>

<h3 id="leveraging-google-search">Leveraging Google Search</h3>
<p>Google search itself is an excellent tool for getting a feel for which keywords are popular, or what common questions come up for  users searching on similar topics.</p>
<p>The <em>“People also ask”</em> and <em>“Related searches”</em> sections on the Google results page give you examples of popular searches on similar topics to the one you entered in your own search. These are extremely valuable, because they are almost always in the form of those important long-tail keyword phrases.</p>
<p>Let’s talk a little about keyword volume and competitor research. You might end up ranking on the first page of Google for a specific keyword, but if no one ever searches for it, it won’t result in traffic to your site. Similarly, if you target a keyword that has a huge amount of competition, you’ll waste resources trying to beat rankings of much more established stores. There are many sites out there that can tell you how many times a certain keyword has been searched for in the last month, let you know how much  competition there is out there for those keywords, and suggest other related keywords to you.</p>
<h2 id="seo-implementations-in-html">SEO Implementations in HTML</h2>
<h3 id="importance-of-using-semantic-html">Importance of Using Semantic HTML</h3>
<p>Using semantic HTML, like headings, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> in your projects is also helpful for SEO. From the perspective of SEO, these elements are prime real estate for the keywords you have identified. Search engines put more weight on words that are inside semantic HTML elements like headings <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> and where words in a <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> having more weight than words inside a <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> for example. The text inside a <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> or emphasis (<code>&lt;em&gt;</code>) element is also more important to search engines than a standard paragraph tag (<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>).</p>
<p>Another type of HTML element that is important to think about is the anchor tag (<code>&lt;a&gt;</code>). Links within your own web application, and to external websites, are very important to search engines. The text inside a link is important as well as the link itself.</p>
<p>Social links that contain the <code>rel=&quot;noopener&quot;</code> attribute, tells search engines not to include these links when it looks at our search engine ranking. Links to Facebook, Twitter and other social media websites don’t say anything about what this page is about, which is why you don’t want Google to include them in its&rsquo; assessment of your web page.</p>
<h3 id="linking-to-trustworthy-websites">Linking to Trustworthy Websites</h3>
<p>Also, linking to other high quality relevant websites will improve your website’s ranking further. So what kinds of sites would it make sense to link to within your home page?  </p>
<p>For a bakery in Galway, Ireland, you don’t want links to other bakeries, but what other links buyers might find useful? How about baking sale events? Or a bakery association they work in partnership with? Maybe the bakery was featured in a baking and recipes blog? If yes, you should link to that blog post from your own website.
All of these kinds of links show search engines that your page is good quality. Depending on the content of your site, you might want to include links such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>Charities you support, clubs or associations you are a part of</li>
<li>Companies or brands you have worked with or for</li>
<li>Software your product or service is powered by</li>
<li>Or events your company has taken part in</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, thinking carefully about if this information is relevant to your users. Don’t just stuff in random high quality links if your users won’t find them useful, Google’s algorithms will see through that. When writing your links remember that the content between the anchor tags is also important. If it’s text, try to get a relevant keyword into the link.</p>
<h3 id="seo-in-images">SEO in Images</h3>
<p>Another important area for SEO keyword implementation is in your images. The words you choose in the <code>alt</code> attribute of an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element are important to search engines, so choose your image descriptions with your keywords in mind, remembering of course to actually describe the image, as that attribute’s main purpose is to describe images to visually impaired users. The image file name is also important. If your image file name is called “IMG42.jpg”, that doesn’t tell the search engine anything about the image or its&rsquo; topic. But if you rename that file to “bread-baking.jpg”, suddenly the words in this file become useful for determining the image content.</p>
<h3 id="html-metadata">HTML Metadata</h3>
<p>The final code area to talk about when it comes  to SEO implementations in code is your metadata. Just remember to make sure some of your most important keywords are in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of your HTML files, the title and meta description being the most valuable to search engines. The meta keywords is the one place you have full permission to keyword-stuff to the maximum, as that is what that element is for.</p>
<h3 id="avoid-keyword-stuffing">Avoid Keyword Stuffing!</h3>
<p>You shouldn’t just fill these elements with your chosen keywords with no logic. This practice is commonly known as “keyword stuffing”, and a long time ago web developers and content creators used this technique to try and fool search engines. This practice doesn’t work any more. If your web pages are not deemed to be a high quality search result, all the keyword stuffing in the world won’t make a difference. Google&rsquo;s algorithm is advanced enough to recognize that and it will backfire; ensure the keywords naturally flow in the text.</p>
<h2 id="other-useful-seo-implementations">Other Useful SEO Implementations</h2>
<h3 id="sitemapxml-file"><code>sitemap.xml</code> File</h3>
<p>An xml sitemap is a file that lists a website’s important page URLs, making sure that search engines can crawl, or navigate through them. It also helps search engines understand your website structure. A sitemap file ensures search engines will crawl every essential page on your website. This is especially useful if there are pages of your site that don’t have any internal links pointing to them.
So a sitemap can help speed up content discovery for search engines when they crawl and index your web applications. <a href="https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/">XML Sitemaps</a> is where you go to generate a sitemap file. Depending on how large your site is, this can take several minutes.</p>
<img src="\undercoverunicorn\images\sitemap-website.png" alt="Sitemap website screenshot">
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve generated the file, you can download it to your PC. You can then drag and drop this file into your project workspace. It also needs to live in the root folder. Make sure this file is named <code>sitemap.xml</code>.</p>
<img src="\undercoverunicorn\images\sitemap-xml-file.png" alt="sitemap.xml file">
<blockquote>
<p>VS Code Theme
If you&rsquo;re wondering what theme am I using, it&rsquo;s Dracula Midnight. Light mode wrecks my head!</p></blockquote>
<h3 id="robotstxt-file"><code>robots.txt</code> File</h3>
<p>The <code>robots.txt</code> file is a simple text file that tells search engines where they are not allowed to go on a website. It lists out any folders or files that will not be crawled or indexed by search engine spiders. Having a <code>robots.txt</code> file shows that you acknowledge that search engines are allowed on your site and that they may have free access to it. For this reason, search engines take the existence of this file in your projects as a sign of quality, and it improves your SEO ranking as a result.</p>
<img src="\undercoverunicorn\images\robots-file.png" alt="robots.txt file">
<p><em>User-agent</em> is another word for robots or search engine spiders. The asterisk denotes that this line applies to all of the spiders. This is a basic <code>robots.txt</code> file. If you want to block the spiders from certain areas of your site, your <code>robots.txt</code> might look something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The above line tells the robots that they&rsquo;re not  allowed to access anything in the <code>accounts</code> URLs.  </li>
<li>The sitemap does include URLs to signup and sign-in within the accounts URLs, so this line here will prevent Google from crawling those as well.</li>
<li>If you wanted to disallow another URL section from the spiders, you would need to add another Disallow line for each underneath, like shown in the screenshot.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last line added here in our <code>robots.txt</code> file is the URL to the sitemap file just created by adding the link to the deployed site and with the /sitemap.xml filename at the end. Once you have saved your sitemap and robots flies, you can commit and push them to your deployed site.</p>
<h3 id="final-steps">Final Steps</h3>
<p>The final steps for working with a sitemap and robots files can only be implemented for  web applications that have a DNS certificate. Creating a DNS certificate is part of the process of deploying a web application to a custom domain. The steps involved in registering and wiring up a custom domain require you to have a credit card and to make  payments.</p>
<p>A sitemap should be registered with Google. You can do this in the Google Search console. And you can also test your robots.txt file for errors.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="tips">Tips</h4>
<ul>
<li>Research other sites that already meet the needs your users have, find examples of how they accomplish that.</li>
<li>Use the keyword table above as an example to help prompt ideas for your own document</li>
<li>Document your process. You would be amazed how much you&rsquo;d learn when you document your thought process.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>With that said, good luck researching your keywords, hope this article helped! From my experience, SEO research was a bit of a pain, but with focus and by asking the right questions, you&rsquo;ll be set to find those keywords for your project!</p>
<p><em>Be kind to yourself. Keep achieving!</em></p>
