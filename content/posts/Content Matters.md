# Content Matters

When it comes to SEO, keywords aren't everything. The content of the website is crucial for the search engine to determine whether it will rank high or not.

## Content is King

The more useful, well informed and trustworthy your web page content is, the higher it will rank in search engines. Great content is what helps your rankings most. Keywords will help users find you, but the content of your web pages is what will keep them on your site once they get there. 

So how can Google Search know if a web page is a high quality search result? You would imagine the metrics are very advanced, and code alone would struggle to determine this. 

### Google Raters

This is where the Google Raters come in. Google Raters are humans, employed by Google to teach their software which websites and search results are high quality, and which are low quality. Google Raters are trained on a 175 page document called the “Rater Guidelines”. This document is freely available online. These guidelines outline what makes a web page a high quality search result. In a nutshell, a site that exhibits the following:

1. Expertise
2. Authoritativeness
3. Trustworthiness 

is deemed to be high quality.

Sites that exhibit these qualities are upfront about who they are, clear about where their information comes from, and cite sources to other trustworthy sites. A site's ranking in these key areas far outweighs the relevance of the keywords used when ranking search results. Let’s take an example of a search on a topic asking for medical advice. For user safety, Google would only want to provide users with results from trusted medical resources. With this in mind, you must realize by now that in order to rank highly on Google, your site needs to be genuinely useful and engaging for your users. Knowing about which keywords your potential customers will use, and ensuring they are included in your projects is great, but that alone won’t be enough in the eyes of the biggest search engine on the internet. 

### Google Metrics

Beyond the Google Raters, Google also uses metrics to gauge the usefulness of your site content.  
These metrics include:

* **CTR**, or “click through rate”, is how often users click the page link when it shows up in Google search results. As the information shown to users on Google comes from the title and meta description of the page, improving your CTR means making sure these are relevant and indicate that your content will be useful to someone searching for your relevant keywords.

* **Bounce rate** is another important metric to Google. This rate is calculated by how likely a user is to click the back button or close the tab as soon as they land on your page. If the bounce rate is high, your ranking will be lower, because it indicates to Google that the content on your page is not very relevant.

* **Dwell time** is how long the user stays on the page before clicking back to the search results. The longer the dwell time the better, because it indicates that your content was interesting and they took time to look through it.

* **Session time** is measured in how long the user stayed on your site as a whole. They might start on one page, but click a link through to another that was more interesting or useful to them.

* Finally, **pages per session** is a metric that Google records to see how many of your website pages the user visited before moving back to search or on to another web page.


With these metrics in mind, it’s easy to see why interesting, well explained, well laid out, great user experience websites are the ones that rank highly on Google.

### Other Elements to Consider

So, beyond your code and project files, what can you include on your site to ensure your users find your content interesting, trustworthy, authoritative and ensure that you show expertise?

Well, there is no short answer. It depends on who your web application is for. It goes back to your user personas, understanding who your users are and what they need and want. Then creating engaging content that meets those things. Your content should be professional, avoiding typos and spelling mistakes. 

Ensure your users' questions are answered clearly. A quick and easy way to do this for an e-commerce application is to include an FAQs page for any frequently asked questions. All the information you provide should be correct. Depending on what your content topic is, it might be appropriate to include citation links to back up your claims or show your research. 

If your content teaches something, including clear well explained examples is a great way  to show expertise and authoritativeness. Adding relevant links to other parts of your site will help your users to keep exploring, clicking through to other pages. For example, an online store product page that includes links to other related products. Or a blog that links back to other blog posts on relevant topics. Make it easy for your users to discover more of what you have on offer, and you’ll keep them on your site for longer.

Speaking of links, including ones to your privacy statement, terms of service and terms and conditions are great ways to show a user they can trust your application. When selling products or services, testimonials, reviews and ratings help build trust too. Content also includes media like images, audio and video. The higher the quality these are, the more professional your website content will be. Images should of course be optimized for the web, so you’re not asking browsers to load huge files, it is the quality of the images that will inspire an overall feeling of quality for your website and its content.

#### Questions to ask yourself:

1. What do your users need?
2. What information and features can you provide to meet those needs?
3. How can you make the information easy to understand?
4. How can you demonstrate expertise, authoritativeness and trustworthiness in your content?
5. Would there be other pages within your own site you could link to from your chosen page?
6. Are there opportunities to link back to external websites that already rank highly on Google?
7. How can you help users discover other relevant parts of your web application?

## Final Thoughts

Researching isn't always the most interesting thing you could be doing (I should know!), but it's like a muscle; the more you train yourself to research, the easier it gets! I hope this article was helpful and make sure to check out other links down below for more information!
