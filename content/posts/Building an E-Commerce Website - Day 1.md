# Building an E-Commerce Website - Day 1


## What Is E-Commerce?

According to Amazon, *"Ecommerce or "electronic commerce" isÂ **the trading of goods and services online**. The internet allows individuals and businesses to buy and sell an increasing amount of physical goods, digital goods, and services electronically."*

So basically, any website that sells something, whether it's physical products, services, or digital products, is considered an e-commerce website.

E-commerce websites have completely changed the game when it comes to business. It is a lot more effortless, all you need is a laptop/smartphone with an Internet connection, a credit card and you're good to go! 

Although it's not that easy. Some websites can be actual scams and you can end up with no product, and no money! So, always check the reviews and ensure the website you're planning to purchase from is reliable.

## What Am I At?

Sooo, I'm currently studying software development within Code Institute's course "Diploma in Full Stack Software Development (E-commerce Applications)" and as I'm nearing the end of the course (I'm not sponsored by them in any way), I have to plan, build and deploy an e-commerce website. I have a list of prerequisites and technologies that I need to use, and I have to follow the Agile methodology to showcase my thought process when it comes to creating websites (*article on the Agile methodology coming up soon!*).

These are the technologies that I am required to use and which I'm most comfortable with at the moment:

**Backend**: Django, Python
**Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript
**Database**: PostgreSQL
**Version Control**: Git, GitHub, Heroku

I have the liberty to choose what I want the website to be about, so I chose honey products, since there is a lot in information regarding honey products, honey usage and beekeeping. And let's face it, everyone loves honey!

I think it's safe to say that I'm not a very experienced developer yet, but I'm definitely a lot more confident than I was a year ago! I'm also a firm believer that building confidence is key when it comes to learning new skills like software development. The perfect way to build confidence when learning software development is ==to do projects==. Building projects are a great way of showcasing your skills, and you're going to learn A LOT more than if you'd just learn the theory.

I'm not saying to not learn theory as well, theory is very important, it can spare you from some very annoying bugs and you don't need to invent the wheel again. But it's crucial to apply the theory.

I used to just watch videos and take notes, and I wasn't practicing at all. Needless to say, when I had to create my first project using only HTML and CSS, I was frightened, even though the theory of these two languages was very easy and logical. It's that panic setting in, where you ask yourself: 

	"Where do I start? What do I do? What if I make a mistake?!"

It's fine. 

You'll make mistakes. Tons of them, actually.

But if you create a mindset of trying to resolve and learn from them, these mistakes are worth it. Because they'll help you become a great software developer. And since technologies are changing all the time, you'll constantly be learning! 

This isn't my first website that I have to build; this course doesn't use exams to score students, but it uses projects. There are different courses depending on what you prefer. For example, I had 5 projects across the course that I had to complete in order to graduate from this course, and my capstone project (the one that I'm writing about right now) is *E-commerce Applications*. Other students would've had *Predictive Analytics* or *Advanced Frontend*. 

I'll link my GitHub where all my portfolio projects are pinned on my profile. Feel free to check them out, I'll also look into writing about them in future articles! ðŸ˜Š
### Features

The features that will be present in this website are pretty basic considering that it is an e-commerce website. It will have user authentication, payment options, commenting and reviewing products, a checkout section, and even a blog where users can find out more about the benefits of honey and even a few recipes!

I will use two existing websites for a bit of inspo when it comes to designing: [Honey Heaven](https://www.honeyheaven.co.uk/) (based in UK) and [Leahy Beekeeping](https://www.leahybeekeeping.com/) (based in Ireland). They look good to me and I can use them to see what can I improve upon.
